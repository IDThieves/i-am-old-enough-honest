# i-am-old-enough-honest

This is the 2-week MVP project for providing an alternative to carrying photo ID's. This is an app that allows people to upload a photo of their Driving license or passport, subject to the admin's approval, the app is then shown at clubs and thus potentially preventing loss of the original photo ID. 

We have used [Hapi.js](http://hapijs.com/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) and the [mongoose-crate-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-crate-s3) module.

###How to run

```
clone the repository
cd into i-am-old-enough-honest
npm install
nodemon or node app.js
http://localhost:3000
```
###Live
The app can be found at: http://kiwi-id.herokuapp.com/
